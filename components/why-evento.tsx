            Hack4Freedom is organized by Evento, an events platform that helps communities gather and grow using tools like Bitcoin for payments and support. We believe events create movements and movements change lives.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg">
            Evento is founded by a woman who has worked in Bitcoin for years and has seen how few women are represented in freedom tech. This imbalance limits ideas, limits innovation, and leaves out the people who often benefit the most.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg">
            Women in the Global South make up the majority of the unbanked worldwide. They face barriers that Bitcoin can help solve, yet they are rarely included in building the tools themselves.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg">
            Hack4Freedom is our effort to change that, by giving more women in Africa the skills, support, and community they need to become builders.
